## About Me

Hello! I am Ken Suzuki, a Master's student at the University of Pennsylvania GRASP Lab. I graduated with a BS in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Massachusetts Amherst (UMass Amherst) in May 2025.

During most of my time at UMass Amherst, I worked on mechanical design for legged robots at the DARoS Lab, under the supervision of Professor Donghyun Kim.

I previously worked as a Research Intern at the Robotics Group of OMRON SINIC X Corporation, during the summer of 2023. I was supervised 
by Dr. Kazutoshi Tanaka and Dr. Masashi Hamaya for the development of a faster shape memory alloy actuator.
